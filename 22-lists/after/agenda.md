# Lists and Keys - v-for

1. How Vue renders lists

2. Example: shuffle list with DOM state

3. Solution: Use a key

4. Key outside list
    - change key to reset component

5. Your turn
    - Add a button "Reset filter" that resets the filter
    - Modify "Days.vue" to accept any list of strings from its parent
      Does the key still make sense? What would be a better interface for such a component?
