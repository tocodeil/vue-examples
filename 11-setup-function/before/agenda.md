# Define Component Syntax

1. A component without "setup" function
    - add computed value twice
    - add initial value "now"
    - prop types:
    https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html#prop-validation

2. A component in a ".ts" file

3. Your turn
    - solve one of the previous exercises using the "defineComponent" syntax
    - add a numeric prop to HelloWorld.vue
    - modify the code so "now" is updated every time count is increased
