# Reactivity In Vue

1. Reactive Data: ref, computed

2. Reactive data in templates
	- Example click counter
	
3. 2-way data binding (v-model)

4. Your turn:
	- Show the "plus" button only if x < 10
	- Show the "minus" button only if x > 0
	- Pass max and min values as props (10 and 0 is the default)
	- Show multiple <Counter>s on the page, notice how each has its own value
	- Add an <input v-model /> to show and modify x
