# List with Delete Many

1. Create list of items with ids
    - crypto.randomUUID

2. Create a MultiSelectDelete component
    - Show list of items
    - Allow selection
    - Save "selected" in the item (i.e. create a new "ref" with the data from App.vue AND selection status)
    - Add "Delete selected" button

4. Your Turn
    - Add a "Restore" button that restores the list to its original status
    - Add another <MultiSelectDelete />. Selecting items in one list also selects them in the other
